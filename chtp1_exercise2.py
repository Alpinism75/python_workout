""" The challenge here is to write a mysum function that does the same thing as the built-in sum function. 
However, instead of taking a single sequence as a parameter, it should take a variable number of arguments. 
Thus, although you might invoke sum([1,2,3]), youâ€™d instead invoke mysum(1,2,3) or mysum(10,20,30,40,50).

"""
Write a function that takes a list of numbers. It should return the average (i.e., arithmetic mean) of those numbers.

Write a function that takes a list of words (strings). 
It should return a tuple containing three integers, representing the length of the shortest word, 
the length of the longest word, and the average word length.

Write a function that takes a list of Python objects. 
Sum the objects that either are integers or can be turned into integers, ignoring the others.
