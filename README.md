# Python_Workout

My place to practice Python Code

This is a space for me to work through various coding exercises to practive my python and share my code in preparation for PCAP, and creating a regular coding habit.

One of my aims is to try and ensure that I develop a strong Code Pipeline - with testing for the code I produce and options to automate deployment (where appropriate).

I'm using a various resources for these exercices.  These include:
    
     *Python Workout* book by Reuven M. Lerner
     *Fluent Python* book by Luciano Ramalho
     *Automate the Boring Stuff*  the Udemy course (rather than the book) by Al Sweigart
     
As well as other resources.  I've found these to be some of the best resources to developing my Python, and will try credit these for their respective exercises.
